Number of threads:					1 (with Solaris affinity)		4							8
no volatile, final value 300'000	161.745 ms						74812, 75081, 214.487 ms	37330, 37532, 336.006 ms
volatile, final value 300'000		171.492 ms 						74806, 75075, 224.194 ms 	37436, 37522, 345.630 ms

1. value: lowest number of accesses
2. value: highest number of accesses
3. value: measured duration in ms

Interpretation:
With using more threads, each thread increases the counter less times. As a consequence of the wait part in the algorithm, the duration of the test program increases for a higher number of threads. With one thread there is no wait time, with n threads n-1 threads are waiting on the lock of the one thread.
