Figure 1:
This figure is linearizable an thus also sequentially consistent. All operations can be executed such that a correct order exists:
	1. r.write(1)
	2. r.read(1)
	3. r.write(2)
	4. r.read(2)

Figure 2:
This figure is neither linearizable (value 1 has been overwritten, r.read(1) after r.write(2)) nor sequentially consistent (cannot re-order non-overlapping operations on the same thread, only on different threads).
